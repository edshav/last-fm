This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Main features:

- used Typescript to catch errors early in your editor;

- used RTK Query to cash server data;

- sanitizing the html received from the server before placing it on the page for XSS protection;

- prefetching data when hovering over the pagination button or artist name to improve UX;

- manage query parameters in the browser address bar so you can bookmark
